The drop pins can be shown in <strong>navy</strong> for below trigger threshold or <strong>purple</strong> for above trigger threshold depending on the level of river discharge measured.<br/>The GloFAS forecast is used for the trigger. These forecasts are often used by the National Governmental Meteorological Services.<br/><br/>GloFAS version 3.1 is a global integrated hydro-meteorological forecast- and monitoring system that delivers global ensemble river discharge forecasts (limited up to 5 days ahead in this layer) for the large river basins (greater than 1000 km2). The GloFAS 3.1 is based on the LISFLOOD hydrological model.<br/><br/>Methodology presenting the GloFAS probability levels: Methodology presenting the GloFAS probability levels: The ECMWF-ENS meteorological forecast data contains a 51-member ensemble. The 60% trigger-threshold discharge levels are presented as 'trigger-alert' levels agreed on in the EAP. The probability is the percentage of the 51 ensemble members that predicts that the discharge is above the threshold. The administrative areas in the corresponding country are mapped to a specific GloFAS Station, and as such it is determined which areas are triggered when the station exceeds the trigger threshold value (for more informatie see the EAP).<br/><br/>Source Link: <a href='https://www.globalfloods.eu/'>https://www.globalfloods.eu/</a>",
