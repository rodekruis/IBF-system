Feature: View area-of-focus section

    Background:
        Given a logged-in user on the dashboard page

    Scenario: View area of focus section in NON-TRIGGERED mode
        When the user enters the dashboard page
        Then this section is not visible

    Scenario: View area of focus section in TRIGGERED mode
        When the user enters the dashboard page
        Then the user sees the Area-of-focus summary at the bottom of the middle column
        And it mentions an 'Actions Summary' title
        And it has light-purple background
        And it mentions a list of 7 "areas of focus" with an icon for each
        And for each "area of focus" it lists the "checked" number of actions vs. the total number of actions
        And the total number of actions is the nr of triggered areas times the nr of actions in that area
        And the "checked" number of actions is based on actions in the chat-section (see 'Use_chat_section.feature')
