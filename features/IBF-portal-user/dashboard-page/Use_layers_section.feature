Feature: View and use layers section ('matrix-component' in code)

    Background:
        Given a logged-in user on the dashboard page

    Scenario: View Layers section in collapsed state
        When the user enters the dashboard page
        Then the user sees the Layer-section within the map on the right
        And it is in collapsed state
        And it mentions 'Layers' and has an arrow pointing left
        And it is purple if TRIGGERED and navy-blue if NON-TRIGGERED

    Scenario: Open Layers section
        When the user clicks the 'Layers' section
        Then it opens downwards
        And the arrow in the header now points right
        And it contains a list of all available layers
        And which layers depends on "country", "disaster-type", "triggered-state" (to do: more detail)
        And each indicator has a "label", a "legend" and an "info-button"
        And some of the layers are "active" by default
        And this also depends on "triggered-state"
        And the "active" rows are purple if TRIGGERED and navy-blue if NON-TRIGGERED
        And the "active" rows have the "legend box" filled
        And if a "point layer" it contains a "marker-icon" (the same as in the map. If the map contains multiple versions of this icon, here only one is shown)
        And if a "raster" layer then a square with the color of the raster-layer in the map (e.g. "red" for "flood extent")
        And if a "shape" layer then "grey" (TO DO: should this update after we changed map-colors to purple?)
        And if an "outline" layer ("Alert threshold") then grey with a red outline

    Scenario: View layers section in NON-TRIGGERED mode
        Given the dashboard is in NON-TRIGGERED mode
        When the users views the open layers section
        Then it does show the red outline 'Alert threshold' layer activated
        And depending on disaster-type a default exposure layer is activated
        - 'Exposed population' for 'floods' and 'drought' is NOT activated, as it is always 0 anyway
        - 'Houses affected' for 'typhoon' is NOT activated
        - 'Potential cases' for 'malaria' is activated, as even if no trigger it contains relevant data
        And depending on disaster-type other point/raster layers are default activated where applicable (for 'floods': 'glofas stations')

    Scenario: View layers section in TRIGGERED mode
        Given the dashboard is in TRIGGERED mode
        When the users views the open layers section
        Then it shows the red outline 'Alert threshold' layer activated
        And it shows as main exposure shape layer
        - 'Exposed population' for 'floods', 'drought'
        - 'Potential cases' for 'malaria'
        - 'Houses affected' for 'typhoon'
        And depending on disaster-type other point/raster layers are default activated where applicable (for 'flodos': 'glofas stations' AND 'flood extent')

    Scenario: Unselect selected layer
        When the user unselects a currently selected layer
        Then the layer switches to "unselected" mode
        And the data is no longer visible in the map
        And the legend for the layer in the map - if applicable - disappears

    Scenario: Unselect 'Alert threshold' layer
        When the user unselects the 'Alert threshold' layer
        Then nothing happens as this is not possible
        And the red outline always stays visible in the map (or not if 'NON-TRIGGERED')

    Scenario: Select unselected layer
        When the user selects an unselected layer
        Then the layer switches to "selected" mode
        And the data becomes visible in the map

    Scenario: Select unselected "shape" layer
        When the user selects an unselected "shape" layer
        Then a legend appears in the bottom-left of the map, if a "shape"
        And - in addition to the above scenario - any currently selected "shape" layer becomes "unselected"
        And switches to "unselected mode"
        And the data in the map is replaced by the new layer
        And the legend in the map is replaced by the new layer
        And this becomes you can visualize at most one shape-layer at a time, while raster/point-layers can be overlaid on each other infinitely


    Scenario: Click info-button
        When the user clicks on an info-button
        Then a popup opens with description and source links of the layer
        And this information can sometimes be slightly different then the information for the same indicator in the "aggregates section"
        And it contains a close-button

    Scenario: Select point layer with no data
        When the users selects a point layer with no data
        Then the row switches to "selected" mode
        And no data appears in the map, as it is not available.
        And the layer is still included to stimulate end-user to provide data (example: Red Cross branches for some clarity)
