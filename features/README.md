# Test scenario's

IMPORTANT: 

- A major distinction in every feature is whether the Portal is in TRIGGERED or NON-TRIGGERED mode.
- These distinctions are made within each file.
- In practice there can be a 3rd (more rare) scenario: OLD-EVENT. This is sometimes explicity mentioned. Where not further specified, it falls under NON-TRIGGERED.

### How to describe features / define scenarios

Features can be added to this folder by:

- Create a `.feature`-file, named after its title with `_` for spaces;  
  i.e. `Log_in.feature`
- Add a reference to the list above at the appropriate _actor_.
