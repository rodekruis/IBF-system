The 60/70/80% trigger-threshold discharge levels are presented as 'trigger-alert' levels agreed on in the EAP. The probability is the percentage of the 51 ensemble members that predicts that the discharge is above the threshold. The administrative areas in the country correspond are mapped to a specific GloFAS Station, and as such it is determined which areas are triggered when the station exceed the trigger threshold value (for more informatie see the EAP).<br /><br />Source Link: <a href='https://www.globalfloods.eu/'>https://www.globalfloods.eu/</a>"
