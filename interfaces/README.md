# Interfaces

Interfaces of the IBF-system.

-   Visualization of model results (and auxiliary data) through dashboards
-   Dashboards might move from read-only to write-applications, where users can
    also add (secondary) data through an interface

A current example here is the `FBF Zambia interface`:
<https://fbf-zambia.510.global/> with code at
<https://github.com/rodekruis/CommunityRisk/tree/fbf-zambia>.
