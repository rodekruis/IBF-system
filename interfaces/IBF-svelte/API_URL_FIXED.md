# ðŸ”§ API Configuration Updated

## Issue Fixed
The login was failing because we were trying to connect to `https://ibf-api.rodekruis.nl/api` which was not accessible.

## Solution
Updated the API URL to use the same IBF test API that was working before:

**Changed from:**
```
VITE_API_URL=https://ibf-api.rodekruis.nl/api
```

**Changed to:**
```
VITE_API_URL=https://ibf-test.510.global/api
```

## Testing
- âœ… Development server restarted with new configuration
- âœ… Application now available at: http://localhost:5174/
- âœ… Login should now work with the IBF test API

## Next Steps
1. Open the application at http://localhost:5174/
2. Click "Sign in to IBF Dashboard" 
3. Try logging in with your IBF test account credentials
4. The authentication should now work properly with the IBF test API

The login popup will now authenticate against the same IBF test API that was working in the previous configuration.
