## Frontend Performance and Low-Bandwidth Optimization

### Current Performance Issues

Based on the analysis of the frontend codebase, the IBF system faces several significant performance challenges that particularly impact users on low-bandwidth connections:

#### **1. Large Bundle Size**
- **Bundle limits**: Current configuration allows up to 2MB warning threshold and 5MB error threshold
- **Heavy dependencies**: 50+ npm packages including multiple mapping libraries
- **Key contributors**: 
  - Angular 19 + Ionic 8.6.1 (~800KB base)
  - Leaflet + plugins (~300KB)
  - @turf/turf geospatial operations (~500KB)
  - Translation files for multiple languages (~200KB)
  - Chart.js and visualization libraries (~400KB)

#### **2. Asset Loading Issues**
- **Numerous color files**: 20+ individual SCSS color definition files
- **Icon proliferation**: Extensive SVG icon collection in assets/icons/
- **Font loading**: External Google Fonts (Montserrat + Open Sans) loaded via CDN
- **Service worker caching**: Prefetches ALL assets on first load

#### **3. Inefficient Loading Strategy**
- **Preload all modules**: RouterModule uses `PreloadAllModules` strategy
- **Synchronous asset loading**: Critical resources block initial render
- **No code splitting**: Large map component (800+ lines) loads entirely upfront
- **CSS bloat**: Hundreds of CSS custom properties loaded at startup

### Root Cause Analysis

#### **Primary Issues:**

1. **Monolithic Map Component**
   - Single 800+ line component handling all map functionality
   - Loads all mapping libraries and utilities at startup
   - No lazy loading of map features or layers

2. **Asset Management Problems**
   - Service worker prefetches entire asset directory
   - No image optimization or progressive loading
   - SVG icons not bundled/optimized
   - Multiple font families loaded simultaneously

3. **CSS Architecture Issues**
   - 20+ individual color SCSS files
   - Extensive Tailwind CSS with unused utilities
   - No critical CSS extraction
   - Large custom property definitions

4. **Bundle Optimization Gaps**
   - Development-style builds with optimization disabled
   - No tree shaking for unused dependencies
   - Large third-party libraries included entirely

### **Performance Improvement Recommendations**

   - Critical CSS extraction for above-the-fold content
   - Unused Tailwind CSS purging
   - Component-level CSS modules
   ```

#### **Phase 3: Advanced Optimizations (2-3 weeks)**

1. **Service Worker Enhancement**
   ```typescript
   // Smart caching strategy
   assetGroups: [
     {
       name: "critical",
       installMode: "prefetch",
       resources: { files: ["/critical-*.js", "/critical-*.css"] }
     },
     {
       name: "lazy",
       installMode: "lazy",
       resources: { files: ["/assets/**"] }
     }
   ]
   ```

2. **Network Optimization**
   - Implement HTTP/2 push for critical resources
