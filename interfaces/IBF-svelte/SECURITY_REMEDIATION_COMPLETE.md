# Security Remediation Complete âœ…

## Summary
The critical security vulnerability has been successfully remediated. The IBF API credentials that were previously exposed in the client-side JavaScript bundle have been removed.

## Actions Taken

### 1. Immediate Security Response
- âœ… Removed exposed credentials from `.env.local`
- âœ… Cleaned and rebuilt production bundle
- âœ… Verified credentials are no longer in client-side code
- âœ… Added security warnings to configuration system

### 2. Configuration Changes
- Set `VITE_IBF_API_EMAIL=""` (empty)
- Set `VITE_IBF_API_PASSWORD=""` (empty)
- Added `warnAboutCredentials()` function to detect credential exposure
- Application now runs in mock data mode safely

### 3. Verification Complete
- âœ… Production build no longer contains `dunant@redcross.nl`
- âœ… Production build no longer contains `sqgIF1Gm3b1M3ChWljP9lkuwJBAn1FcQ`
- âœ… Bundle size reduced (credentials removed)
- âœ… Application still functional with mock data

## Security Status: SECURED

The immediate vulnerability has been resolved. The application is now safe for deployment without exposing sensitive credentials to website visitors.

## Next Steps Required

### Critical - Password Change
ðŸš¨ **URGENT**: Change the exposed IBF API password `sqgIF1Gm3b1M3ChWljP9lkuwJBAn1FcQ` immediately as it was publicly exposed.

### Architecture Improvements
1. Implement backend proxy authentication
2. Use OAuth/JWT flow instead of direct credentials
3. Move all sensitive authentication to server-side
4. Audit all environment variables for other potential exposures

### Production Checklist
- [ ] Change IBF API password
- [ ] Implement proper authentication architecture
- [ ] Security audit of all VITE_* variables
- [ ] Test authentication flow end-to-end
- [ ] Deploy with new secure configuration

## Impact Assessment
- **Before**: Credentials fully exposed to all website visitors
- **After**: No credentials exposed, application secure for deployment
- **Risk Level**: HIGH â†’ LOW (after password change)
