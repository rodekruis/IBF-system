## Deploy / Remote servers

### Running deploy-script not in sudo mode

Currently the deploy-script must be run in sudo mode. This is aimed to be improved. If you mistakenly run it as a normal user, you need the following to get it working again.

- sudo -i
- cd /home/ibf-user/IBF-system
- git reset --hard <version-number>
- . ./tools/deploy.sh <version-number>
- chown -R ibf-user:ibf-users .

### Install packages in API-service

Sometimes there is an issue with installing all packages for ibf-api-service. You run into a 'ts-node not found' error in the logs of the ibf-api-service.

- sudo -i
- cd /home/ibf-user/IBF-system/services/API-service
- rm -r node_modules
- cd /home/ibf-user/IBF-system
- chown -R ibf-user:ibf-users .
- exit (switch to normal user)
- cd /home/ibf-user/IBF-system/services/API-service
- npm install
- docker compose restart ibf-api-service

### 502 Bad Gateway on API-calls/Swagger UI

Sometimes for unknown reasons the API & Swagger are unavailable, while 'docker compose logs ibf-api-service' tells you that the API is running correctly.

- On the server run 'docker compose restart nginx' in this case
- which will usually solve it.

### Access to files on server

In general it can never hurt to try setting all files to the right ownership. This can for example happen when you have uploaded raster-files via WinSCP to a server. But also in other unexpected ways.

- sudo -i
- cd /home/ibf-user/IBF-system
- chown -R ibf-user:ibf-users .
- exit

## Local set up

This guide is giving some additional tips for troubleshooting when setting up the IBF-system. However, start with the main [README](../README.md) file.

### Expected behaviour after set-up

To check if everything starts up correctly:

- All containers mentioned in the docker-compose file /IBF-system/docker-compose.yml should be up and running. Check e.g. via `docker container ls`
- Application should load and respond properly on http://localhost:4200
- Check the logs of `ibf-api-service` via `docker compose logs -f ibf-api-service`. Is it saying that the Nest application started successfully?
- Can you visit the Swagger UI API documentation on http://localhost:3000/docs and try one of the GET endpoints?

### Problem with existing database

If there is a problem with your existing database schema, you can always try to start clean by recreating it:

- Access the database via e.g. DBeaver
- Alternatively, access it via commandline using
  - `docker compose exec ibf-db bash`
  - `psql -U <chosen local-db-username>`
- Throw away schema via `drop schema "IBF-app" cascade;`
- Recreate schema: `create schema "IBF-app";`
- Exit the database again
- Restart the ibf-api-service: `docker compose restart ibf-api-service` or `docker compose up -d ibf-api-service`
- This will automatically run migration-scripts upon restart, which involves an "initial migration script" which creates all necessary tables.
- Wait until done. Check via `docker compose logs -f ibf-api-service`
- As always (see main [README](../README.md))
  - Run the seed-script
  - Run mock-endpoint (or external pipeline)

### Supporting docker commands

These below commands come in handy when you face such issue:

- The Docker compose command starts and runs your entire app:
  docker compose up

- For dev environment we can use:
  docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml up

- Execute this will create a container named ibf-api-service and start a Bash session:
  docker compose exec ibf-api-service bash

- To run seed script:
  docker compose exec ibf-api-service npm run seed

- Detached mode (-d) run command in the background:
  docker compose up -d ibf-api-service:

- Create the Docker image from the Dockerfile in this folder through:
  docker build -t ibf-api-service

- To check the logs of IBF-api-service:
  docker compose logs -f ibf-api-service

- To restart the IBF-api-service in docker:
  docker compose restart ibf-api-service

- To install the IBF-api-services:
  docker compose exec ibf-api-service npm install
