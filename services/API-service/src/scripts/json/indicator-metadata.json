Flood hazards consider take both the height and velocity of the water into consideration and calculates the hazard levels based on the danger they pose to people and structures. Generally, for an average Filipino with a height of 5’ 6”, areas with flood depths from the knee down can be considered to have low hazard levels. Those with flood depths ranging from the knee to neck are considered to have medium hazard levels, and those covered with floods that are higher than the neck have high hazard levels. However, since the flow velocity is also considered, areas that have shallow but fast-flowing flood waters may have a higher hazard level than that denoted by the height of the flood covering it."

The vulnerability index is a copy of the 'flood vulnerabilty index' used in the IBF Floods portal. It is a composite index for the context of exposure to the hazard and the capacity to anticipate, cope with and recover from the impacts. The National Society and Technical Working group selected the following criteria below: (including their weight in the total score)<ul><li>20% Poverty: Poverty incidence</li><li>20% Gender: Female-headed household</li><li>10% Age: Population below 8-years</li><li>10% Age: population 65+,</li><li>10 % type of construction: permanent wall type</li><li>10 %type of construction: permanent roof type</li><li>20% Refugees legal status #of displaced person</li></ul><br/>For further information please refer to the EAP. For sources of the components, see the source layers in the IBF floods portal."
