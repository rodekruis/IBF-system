The 25-year rain return flood hazard maps show low, medium, and high flood hazards represented as yellow, orange, and red respectively. Flood hazards consider take both the height and velocity of the water into consideration and calculates the hazard levels based on the danger they pose to people and structures. Generally, for an average Filipino with a height of 5’ 6”, areas with flood depths from the kneedown can be considered to have low hazard levels. Those with flood depths ranging from the knee to neckare considered to have medium hazard levels, and those covered with floods that are higher than the neckhave high hazard levels. However, since the flow velocity is also considered, areas that have shallow butfast-flowing flood waters may have a higher hazard level than that denoted by the height of the floodcovering it. "

        "heavy-rain": "Flood susceptibility identifies the most vulnerable areas based on physical characteristics that determine the propensity for flooding” (Vojtek and Vojtekova, 2019). The mapping of flood susceptible areas involves the analysis of multiple criteria for different characteristics of the region that collectively contribute to the likelihood of floods.<br/><br/>Nine influencing parameters based on a variety of satellite imagery and spatial datasets are the input factors of the model, such as topographical (Elevation model, Slope), physical (Land cover, Hydrological soil group) and hydrological properties (Height Above Nearest Drainage, Distance from Nearest Drainage, Topographic Wetness Index Slope, Rain intensity, Rain duration). Set of weights based on expert knowledge (The Analytical Hierarchical Process) from REACH (2019) was adapted in this analysis.<br/><br/><strong>LEGEND:</strong> There are 4 classes of flood susceptibility. The higher the flood susceptibility, the darker blue the color.<br/><br/>SOURCES:<ul><li>REACH.
