Flood hazards consider take both the height and velocity of the water into consideration and calculates the hazard levels based on the danger they pose to people and structures. Generally, for an average Filipino with a height of 5’ 6”, areas with flood depths from the kneedown can be considered to have low hazard levels. Those with flood depths ranging from the knee to neckare considered to have medium hazard levels, and those covered with floods that are higher than the neckhave high hazard levels. However, since the flow velocity is also considered, areas that have shallow butfast-flowing flood waters may have a higher hazard level than that denoted by the height of the floodcovering it."
